## ðŸ“˜ Background

Gliomas are the most common brain tumors, arising from glial cells that support and protect neurons. They vary significantly in behavior and treatment response, ranging from low-grade (slow-growing) to high-grade (aggressive) tumors like glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is particularly deadly, with a median survival of under 15 months even with aggressive therapy.

These tumors thrive through complex interactions with their **tumor microenvironment (TME)**, which includes:
- **Immune cells** (e.g., tumor-associated macrophages, Tregs)
- **Cytokines** (e.g., TGF-Î²)
- **Glioma stem cells**
- **Vascular and nervous system components**
- **Extracellular matrix (ECM)**

Chemical factors such as hypoxia, acidosis, and nutrient deprivation create favorable conditions for glioma survival, while **immune suppression**â€”primarily via TGF-Î²â€”limits CD8+ T cell activity, enabling unchecked tumor growth.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Objective

Our goal was to create a mathematical model using **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** that captures the biological complexity of glioma-immune interactionsâ€”specifically, the suppressive role of **TGF-Î²** and the tumor-fighting role of **CD8+ T cells**. This project builds upon and extends previous models by adding greater biological realism and granularity to immune interactions.

## ðŸ§  Model Development

We started by replicating the original model presented in *A Mathematical Model of Pre-Diagnostic Glioma Growth* (Sharma et al.), validating its:
- Steady states  
- Graphs  
- Parameter sensitivity analysis  

Our replication matched the **revised version** of their model, which included additional terms like vascularization and tumor mutational burden. However, for clarity, we **excluded those features** to isolate and examine immune interactions more directly.

## ðŸ”¬ Improvements in the GlioMath Model

The original immune term was generalized and oversimplified. Our improvements include:

### âœ… Key Enhancements:
- **Replaced single immune term** with:
  - An ODE for **CD8+ T cells** (anti-tumor effect)
  - An ODE for **TGF-Î²** (immunosuppressive factor)
- **Explicit tumor-immune dynamics** modeled via upregulation/downregulation terms
- **Biologically informed assumptions**, including:
  - CD8+ T cell suppression by TGF-Î²
  - Energy dynamics influenced by tumor mass and cytokine production

### ðŸ“‰ Variable Definitions:
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `T` | Glioma cell concentration |
| `Ïƒ_brain` | Brain glucose concentration |
| `CT` | CD8+ T cell concentration |
| `TÎ²` | TGF-Î² concentration |
| `Ïƒ_serum` | Serum glucose concentration |

## ðŸ§ª Model Equations

We implemented immune-specific ODEs sourced from *A Mathematical Model to Elucidate Brain Tumor Abrogation by Immunotherapy with T11 Target Structure* (Banerjee et al.), integrating their parameters and modifying affected terms accordingly.

### Immune Dynamics Highlights:
- **CD8+ T cells** negatively impact tumor growth (`T`)
- **TGF-Î²** positively contributes to tumor progression
- **Brain glucose** consumption is adjusted based on both immune and tumor activity

> Note: Our model still assumes spatial homogeneity but is designed to inform future spatio-temporal extensions.

## ðŸ§¬ Biological Justification

### CD8+ T Cells:
- Infiltrate tumors in response to glioma-associated antigens
- Activated in draining cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs)
- Correlated with improved survival outcomes in glioblastoma patients

### TGF-Î²:
- Secreted by gliomas to suppress immune response
- Directly inhibits CD8+ T cell activation and infiltration
- Key driver of glioma immune evasion

These additions allow our model to reflect **realistic immune-tumor feedback loops** and offer insight into **therapeutic strategies**, such as:
- **TGF-Î² inhibition**
- **CD8+ T cell enhancement**
- **Combinatorial immunotherapy**
